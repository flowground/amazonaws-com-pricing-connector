    "description": "AWS Price List Service API (AWS Price List Service) is a centralized and\nconvenient way to programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services,\nproducts, and pricing information. The AWS Price List Service uses standardized\nproduct attributes such as Location, Storage Class, and Operating System, and\nprovides prices at the SKU level. You can use the AWS Price List Service to\nbuild cost control and scenario planning tools, reconcile billing data, forecast\nfuture spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit analysis that\ncompare your internal workloads with AWS.\n\nUse GetServices without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all AWS\nservices, then GetServices with a service code to retreive the attribute names\nfor that service. After you have the service code and attribute names, you can\nuse GetAttributeValues to see what values are available for an attribute. With\nthe service code and an attribute name and value, you can use GetProducts to\nfind specific products that you're interested in, such as an AmazonEC2 instance,\nwith a Provisioned IOPS volumeType.\n\nService Endpoint\n\nAWS Price List Service API provides the following two endpoints:\n\n *  https://api.pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\n   \n   \n *  https://api.pricing.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com",
